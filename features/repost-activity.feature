Feature: Reposting a post
  In order to share content with my followers
  As a user
  I want to be able to repost a post in my feed

  Scenario: Reposting a post that has not been reposted before
    Given an Actor "Person(Alice)"
    And we follow "Alice"
    And the request is accepted
    And a "Accept(Follow(Alice))" Activity "Accept" by "Alice"
    And "Alice" sends "Accept" to the Inbox
    And "Accept" is in our Inbox
    And a "Create(Note)" Activity "Note" by "Alice"
    And "Alice" sends "Note" to the Inbox
    And "Note" is in our Inbox
    When we repost the object "Note"
    Then a "Announce(Note)" activity is sent to "Alice"
