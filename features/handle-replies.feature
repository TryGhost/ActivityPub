    # Setup our article
    Given a valid "post.published" webhook
    When it is sent to the webhook endpoint
    Then the request is accepted

    Given the found "Create(Article)" as "ArticleCreate(OurArticle)"

    Given an Actor "Alice"
    Given a "Note" Object "Reply" by "Alice"
    And "Reply" is a reply to "OurArticle"
