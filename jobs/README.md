# Jobs

To create a new job, run the following command:

```bash
./new.sh 'do-something-cool'
```

Note: you don't need to suffix the job name with `-job`

This will create a new job in the `jobs` directory with the given name

The job will be created with a template that can be modified to fit the needs of the job
